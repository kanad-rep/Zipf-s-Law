This is a simple graphical representation of Zipf's Law using term frequencies, calculated for three different text data.

# Zipf-s-Law

Zipfâ€™s law states that within a group or corpus of documents, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in a frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.


The data used for this code are:
1. Alice in Wonderland
2. Sherlock Holmes
3. The Time Machine

To plot the graphs, matplotlib package implemented in python is used.
